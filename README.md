### How does this game function??
This memory game is built using React.js. There are 16 characters that are saved in a json file, put into an array, and shuffled when the page loads. The goal for the user is to select all 16 images without clicking on the same image more than once. The catch? After each click, the images are shuffled increasing the difficulty! Score is kept and displayed at the top right of the screen. Top Scores are stored and displayed next to the current score.

### Technologies used
* React.js
* React-Bootstrap for styling
* gh-pages for deployment
